/**
 * With hardware interrupts we should be able not only to register but also
 * unregister handlers (for example, if device is pluggable, like external HDD,
 * though we are not going to supports things like that).
 *
 * In real world operating system kernel things can be even more complicated,
 * just a few examples to give you an idea:
 *  - a few devices can share the same IRQ (signal the same interrupt), so we
 *    need to be able to register a few handlers for the same interrupt
 *  - mapping between devices and interrupts differs between architectures
 *    or even different configurations of the same architechture (x86: PIC vs
 *    APIC), so it's not easy to come up with an abstraction able to handle all
 *    different cases gracefully
 *  - there may be quite a few devices so you might need to decide which CPU
 *    handles what devices, moreover cost of handling an interrupt from the
 *    same device may be different on differnet CPUs.
 *
 * But all these complications are beyond scope of this example, so in our case
 * it will be simple interface:
 *  - allocate_interrupt - finds a free entry in the IDT, so we can use it for
 *    our purporses
 *  - register_interrupt_handler - registers a handler for previously allocated
 *    interrupt
 *
 * And who and how maps devices on interrupts is not concern of the interface
 * (though in real world it, probably, should be, since allocation of interrupt
 * and mapping might be very closely connected/dependent).
