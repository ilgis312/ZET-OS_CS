/**
 * All required paging setup was actually done in bootstrap.S,
 * so this function actually just creates a new page table that maps
 * the whole pysical memory into some range of our logical address
 * space. One of conveniences of 64bit architectures is that a
 * logical address space is huge, at least much larger than amount
 * of physical memory one can have in a computer system. So we can
 * just map the phole physical memory so that we have at least one
 * logical address for every physical address (may be not the only one).
